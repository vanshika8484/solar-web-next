      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
        Dear Members,<br />
        As we step into the post-Diwali season, I hope your celebrations were filled with joy and prosperity. Diwali,
        a festival of lights, symbolizes new beginnings and opportunities. With the festive spirit still in the air,
        it’s time to reflect on our accomplishments and gear up for the upcoming year.
